# Endless-OOP

Thinkof this as a starter project for creating sidescrolling endless runner games like Jetpack Joyride. This Version 
more object oriented than the other version posted earlier. 

The Objects include: 

* IndestructibleObstacle - An obstacle that the player can not destroy
* DestructibleObstacle - An Obstacle that can be destroyed 
* Player - A player Object 
* BackgroundSection - One section of background scenery that scrolls past and is the landscape the player interacts with. 
There are two of these that make up the endless scrolling scene. 
* Ground - The ground in a background section.

Coming Soon: 

* State Machine
